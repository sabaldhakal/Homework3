Homework 3: Time for a Time Out

Basic measurement units (http://www.rapidtables.com/convert/length/index.htm)

* 1 meter = <39.37007874> inches

* 1 mile = <5280> feet

* 1 mile = <1609.344> meters

* Circumference of the Earth = <24901> miles (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth)


Basic terminology (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_prefix)

* yotta something = <10^24> times something

* zetta something = <10^21> times something

* exa something = <10^18> times something

* peta something = <10^15> times something

* tera something = <10^12> times something

* giga something = <10^9> times something

* mega something = <10^6> times something

* kilo something = <10^3> times something

* <hecto> something = 100 times something

* <deca> something = 10 times something

* something = something (duh!)

* deci something = 1/<10> of something

* centi something = 1/<100> of something

* milli something = 1/<10^3> of something

* micro something = 1/<10^6> of something

* nano something = 1/<10^9> of something

* <pico>something = 1/1000000000000 of something

* femto something = 1/10^15 of something

* atto something = 1/10^18 of something

* zepto something = 1/10^21 of something

* yocto something = 1/10^24 of something


From Physics

Speed of light 	= 186,282 mi/s

		= 299792.458 km/s




Speed of Electronic Signals

In one nanosecond = 11.8 inches.

In one microsecond = 983.57 feet.

In one millisecond =  186.28 miles.

In one second = 186282 miles.

In one second = 7.48 times around the Earth!



From our World of Processors

Haswell Processor

* Intel i7-7700, 7th Generation Pentium chip

- Manufacturing Process = <14>nm

- Transistor Count = <3400000000> transistors

- Die Size: <1406.25mm^2>

Lookup this information on the chip:

* Number of cores = <4>

* Number of threads = <8>

* Maximum (turbo) clock frequency = <4.20> GHz.

* Maximum memory = <64> GB.



Transistor Count: 3.4 billion

58309.5 on each side. 58309 on one side and 58310 on another to be accurate. 

Area = 1406.25mm^2 (37.5mm * 37.5mm)

Length of the chip = 37.5mm

Distance between transistors = 15.6 nm (58310/37.5 = 1555mm = 15.6 nm)

Yes, it is close to the manufacturerâ€™s current technology. They report their ability to sqeeze transistors together in 14nm.  

Assuming the distance between transistors are 14nm. 

Time to move electrons between adjacent transistors = <4197094.41> picoseconds. (conversion from seconds to picoseconds, km to nm * 14nm)



Counting up



Time until the register hit the maximum value = <216> years ( (2^64 -1)/ (8.5*10^16) )
